<p align="center"><font size="+2">Cyber security is crucial for any business to preserve the integrity of data. If systems were not secure, they would be open to all sorts of malicious attacks which can potentially destroy an organisation as well as affecting the public. The significance of cyber security is always increasing as the use of smartphones, tablets, computers and the Internet has become an essential part of life. From online banking, social media, storing sensitive information, technology has become a global hub in which people can access their information from the touch of a screen. Along with the increase of digital convenience, it is vital that this data is safe and does not fall into the hands of criminals.</font></p><br><br>
