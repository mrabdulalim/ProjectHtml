<br><br><br><br><h1><b><u><p align="center"><font size="+4">How do hackers attack?</font></p></u></b></h1>
<p align="center"><font size="+2">Hackers are developing different strategies as means of perpetrating their victims. Some tactics are more common than others, but it is imperative to stay aware of these methods and how one can protect themselves from being vulnerable. Here are explanations of social engineering methods in how cyber criminals attack:

<p align="center">Phishing – This is a broad term that can be split into other subcategories and it is also the most common approach. Hackers will attempt to trap their victims by persuading them to click on dodgy links on emails, texts, social media. Hackers can impersonate banks or local enforcement using fear to sway their victims.Honey trap – Attackers will use romance as a weapon against a user. They typically pretend to show romantic interest to lure their victim in order to swiftly access sensitive data or money.</p>

<p align="center">Tailgating – When criminals physically enter a restricted area, then access an employee’s device to access their device or other sensitive data within the company’s network. They could also manipulate other staff members.</p>

<p align="center">Weak passwords – If passwords are easy to guess, this makes it easier for someone to gain access. It is always recommended to use long and complex passwords.</p>

<p align="center">Outdated security software – If a software is old, it may contain bugs and will not receive the relevant fixes therefore weakening the software’s integrity. New updates work on improving the current state of security.</p></font></p>
